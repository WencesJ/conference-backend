### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, the follow tools need to be installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
-   [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Installation

Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/wencesJ/figo-payment.git
```

Move into the project directory and install it's dependencies:

```
cd figo-payment/
npm install
```

To start the dev API server run the following command:

```
npm start
```

For Rapid Developement Use An Api Client eg:

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

```
Todo:Api Documentation
```

**Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/`!

Open the `figo-payment` directory in your code editor of choice and edit files under `src`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

**For working on the repository, you'll have to follow these steps:**

1: Fork the repo

2: Create a new branch on the forked repository. The name of the new branch should be `issue-<ISSUE NO>`.

3: Clone the repository on your system.

4: Work on the new branch and push the code.

5: Create a PR.


### Actions I could have implemented with time:
- Socket Connection using "Socket.io" to enable realtime chat between users
- Threading
- Completing all endpoints tests cases(But all endpoints have been tested with postman)

**Reason for the Above Incomplete Actions:**
- Spent a considerable amount of time creating and tweaking the project structure libraries(libs).
