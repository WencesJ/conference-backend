I am happy with the structure as it easier for scaling and easier developers to learn and adapt with it.

I have developed many projects, but they are private projects, some have been hosted.

If during your reviews of the assessments and you come across a better code structure you consider as industry standard, i would so much like to take a review and study it, so i can improve my structure and so it can aid my experience.
